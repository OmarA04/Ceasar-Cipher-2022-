# Encryption & Decryption using Caesar's Cipher

Caesar's Cipher is simple substitution cipher, In this python program you will be able to encrypt / decrypt text messages (Letters, Numbers & Special characters) & .txt files

Text Encryption - (Key is randomly generated within (1-26) range which is the shift of the letters)

File Encryption - (Key is a randomly generated string of 16digits, key is not the shift yet is a random string)

# How to use the code

   Text Encryption & Decryption

* Press (1) to select text Encryption/ Decryption

* Press (1) for Encryption

* Enter the message which you would like to encrypt

* The encrypted message will be printed with a randomly generated key

* To decrypt the message simply select (2) from the text Encryption / Decryption menu 

* Enter the message you want to decrypt as well as the key & your decrypted message will be printed

File Encryption & Decryption

* Press (2) for File Encryption / Decryption

* Press (1) for Encryption

* A GUI prompt will appear, Click on browse & select the .txt file you want to encrypt then click on "ok"

* A randomly generated key will be printed (Key needed to decrypt file) & Your file will be enrypted & saved in the folder that "Cipher.py" is placed in

* To decrypt the file select (2) from the file Encryption / Decryption menu

* Browse for the file you want to decrypt & select it

* Enter the key that was given in the file encryption process

* File will be decrypted & saved in the folder that "Cipher.py" is placed in


## Caesar's Cipher Example

Left shift of 3

The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The cipher illustrated here uses a left shift of three, so that each occurrence of F in the plaintext becomes C in the ciphertext

Left Shift Of 3

plaintext : ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

ciphertext : XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

Right Shift of 3 (Decryption)

The cipher here moves replaces each character with a right shift of 3 which is the key to be replaces with the plain text
